# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-

Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players, X and O, to take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.
